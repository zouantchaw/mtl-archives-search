Proposed commands (run manually after backing up the originals) to normalize the legacy `.jpeg` files:

# Example: create `.jpg` duplicates alongside the existing `.jpeg` files
cp "/Volumes/FREE SPACE/mtl_archives_photographs/mtl_archives_image_10000.jpeg" "/Volumes/FREE SPACE/mtl_archives_photographs/mtl_archives_image_10000.jpg"
cp "/Volumes/FREE SPACE/mtl_archives_photographs/mtl_archives_image_10001.jpeg" "/Volumes/FREE SPACE/mtl_archives_photographs/mtl_archives_image_10001.jpg"
cp "/Volumes/FREE SPACE/mtl_archives_photographs/mtl_archives_image_10002.jpeg" "/Volumes/FREE SPACE/mtl_archives_photographs/mtl_archives_image_10002.jpg"
cp "/Volumes/FREE SPACE/mtl_archives_photographs/mtl_archives_image_10003.jpeg" "/Volumes/FREE SPACE/mtl_archives_photographs/mtl_archives_image_10003.jpg"
cp "/Volumes/FREE SPACE/mtl_archives_photographs/mtl_archives_image_10004.jpeg" "/Volumes/FREE SPACE/mtl_archives_photographs/mtl_archives_image_10004.jpg"

# After verifying the copies, update the manifest to point to the `.jpg` variants or replace the originals.
